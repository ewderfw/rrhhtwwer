import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'
# Theme switch
Just modify the `/themes/index.js` file in the code to switch between multiple themes.

```javascript
export * from './NEXT' // the Theme effect

// other theme
// export * from './Fukasawa'
// export * from './Hexo'
```


The following 3 themes are currently supported, and there is a config_theme.js file under each theme for style configuration.

## Next
![Next Theme](/demo.png)


## Hexo
![Hexo Theme](/theme-hexo.png)
## Fukasawa
![Fukasawa Theme](/theme-fukasawa.png)

## Medium
![Medium Theme](/theme-medium.png)

## Empty
The themes/Empty directory is an empty template. When creating a new set of themes, you can copy this directory for development. The theme style is developed using the React+TailwindCss framework. Welcome all technical gods to submit their own themes~
