## What is NotionNext

import Bleed from 'nextra-theme-docs/bleed'

**NotionNext**  is a blog generator based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) .

It supports writing articles in the pages of your Notion notebook, and static article pages are generated by NotionNext and hosted in Vercel's cloud service. Similar to traditional Hexo blogs, you do not need to log in to a background editing system separately to edit and publish. Everything is done in your notebook, and you can write blogs anytime, anywhere, record your work ideas and life insights.

Unlike static hosting blogs such as Hexo, due to the powerful support of NextJs, you do not need to redeploy the Github project every time you write a good article, NotionNext will automatically synchronize your articles in real time.

In just a few minutes, you will have a blog like this:
